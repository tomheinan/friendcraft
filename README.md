FriendCraft
===========

Welcome to **FriendCraft**, a universal friends list plugin for Minecraft.

FriendCraft helps you keep track of your friends in Minecraft. You can add players to your friends list to see their status, get notifications when they join a server, and keep in touch with unified messaging. FriendCraft uses a powerful, real-time centralized network, so you can access your list - and your friends - from any server that has this plugin installed.
